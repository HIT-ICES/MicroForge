## Data Source Integration

Users can import existing data from physical or user environments through standardized interfaces, or define and register new data sources based on specific experimental requirements. This flexible mechanism ensures a wide range of data input options. As shown below, a user-defined data source is demonstrated, where payment information for each service is defined to calculate fairness metrics for each service.
