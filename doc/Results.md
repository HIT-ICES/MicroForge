## Data Source Integration

Users can import existing data from physical or user environments through standardized interfaces, or define and register new data sources based on specific experimental requirements. This flexible mechanism ensures a wide range of data input options. As shown below, a user-defined data source is demonstrated, where payment information for each service is defined to calculate fairness metrics for each service.

## Algorithm Registration

Users packaged and registered algorithms on the platform. The algorithms were categorized into two types: analysis algorithms for feature extraction and system understanding, and planning algorithms for decision-making and strategy generation. The platform demonstrated support for modular and API-based integration. As shown blow, a code packaging example is presented. Notably, users were not required to modify their existing algorithm implementations; they only needed to incorporate lightweight web service interfaces to enable platform integration.

```python
@app.route( rule:"/algorithm1', methods=['POST'])
def evaluate 1():
    #Receive JSON data from the reguest
    # The first data source is the task list, which comes from the analysis algorithm
    # The second data source is the server list.
    jobs = json.loads(request.get_json()['dataSourceValue'][0]['value']
    servers = json.loads(request.get_json()['dataSourceValue'][1]['value']
    #Extract the algorithm parameters from the request
    # which are generally the configuration or constraints reguired by the algorithm.parameter =request.get json()['parameter']
    # Call the specific algorithm logic
    allocation_1 = algorithm_1(servers, jobs, parameter)
    return allocation_1
```

## Result Presentation and Feedback

The final results are displayed through the platform interface.

Additionally, the results can be fed back into the system to support performance evaluation, optimization, and iterative experimentation. For instance, based on the deployment plan generated by the algorithm, the service deployment structure can be modified and service performance can be subsequently tested to validate the algorithm's effectiveness. The algorithm results can also be translated into the input format required by the executor, enabling automated execution. Furthermore, user-defined execution methods can be integrated into the executor according to the configuration illustrated above.
